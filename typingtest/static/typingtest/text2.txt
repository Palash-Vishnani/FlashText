today I just feel like staying at home and doing nothing
my mother asked me not to feed the dog until after we had all eaten
she would often bring home table scraps from the restaurant where she worked to feed to her dog
the thick foliage and intertwined vines made the hike nearly impossible
he was an introvert that extroverts seemed to love
he found the end of the rainbow and was surprised at what he found there
my dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth
the tears of a clown make my lipstick run but my shower cap is still intact
the external scars tell only part of the story
